# leuville-arduino-lmic-easy
Various programming utilities for Arduino devices designed to send and receive LoRaWAN messages with LMIC library.
LMICWrapper is a base class for LoRaWAN endnodes built on top of LMIC library.
ProtobufEndnode is a subclass of LMICWrapper which uses ProtocolBuffer to serialize/deserialize LoRaWAN messages.

The classes in this library are normally intended to be used inside a class that overrides one or more of the virtual methods.

### LMICWrapper
LMICWrapper is a base class for LoRaWAN endnodes built on top of LMIC library. It has been tested with two LMIC implementations (see Required libraries section).

LMICWrapper stores LoRaWAN messages into a deque object (STL) which acts as a FIFO list of messages waiting to be sent. Each time runloopOnce() is called (typically from main loop), a LMIC callback job is registered to send first back object of this deque. When the callback job is performed, the first-out message is sent and removed from the deque if isTxCompleted() returns true. By this way, LoRaWAN messages are not lost if the radio or the network are not available.

### ProtobufEndnode<>
ProtobufEndnode is a subclass of LMICWrapper which uses ProtocolBuffer to serialize/deserialize LoRaWAN messages.

ProtobufEndnode is a template class parametrized by ProtocolBuffer message types generated by Nanopb implementation from .proto description. It behaves the same as LMICWrapper, except it encodes/decodes messages.

## Example 1: TestLMICWrapper.ino
This example builds a LoRaWAN device as a subclass of LMICWrapper, with:

 1. a callback set on button connected to A0 pin. This callback sends a "CLICK" message each time the button is pressed.
 2. a timer to send a "TIMEOUT" message each 5 mn
 3. a standby mode feature

 ## Example 2: TestProtobufEndnode.ino
This example shows how to serialize/deserialize LoRaWAN messages with ProtocolBuffer.
The endnode device is the same as the one built in TestLMICWrapper.ino sample.

The message sent by the device is defined with a .proto file like this one:

    syntax = "proto3";
    
    package leuville;
    
    enum Type {
    	PING 	= 0;
    	BUTTON 	= 1;
    }
    
    message Uplink {		
    	Type	type			= 1;
    	uint32	battery 		= 2;
    }
    
    message Downlink {
    	uint32	pingDelay		= 1;	// seconds
    }
In this example, the LoRaWAN uplink message is encoded with these data:

 1. A type which may be PING or BUTTON. PING is sent on timed regular basis, BUTTON is sent when an interrupt occurs.
 2. The battery level in range 0..100
