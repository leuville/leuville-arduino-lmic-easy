# leuville-arduino-lmic-easy
Various programming utilities for Arduino devices designed to send and receive LoRaWAN messages with LMIC library.
LMICWrapper is a base class for LoRaWAN endnodes built on top of LMIC library.
ProtobufEndnode is a subclass of LMICWrapper which uses ProtocolBuffer to serialize/deserialize LoRaWAN messages.

The classes in this library are normally intended to be used inside a class that overrides one or more of the virtual methods.

### LMICWrapper
LMICWrapper is a base class for LoRaWAN endnodes built on top of LMIC library. It has been tested with two LMIC implementations (see Required libraries section).

LMICWrapper stores LoRaWAN messages into a deque object (STL) which acts as Ã  FIFO list of messages waiting to be sent. Each time runloopOnce() is called, a LMIC callback job is registered to send first back object of this deque. When the callback job

### ProtobufEndnode<>
ProtobufEndnode is a subclass of LMICWrapper which uses ProtocolBuffer to serialize/deserialize LoRaWAN messages.
 
## Example 1: TestLMICWrapper.ino
This example builds a LoRaWAN device with:

 1. a callback set on button connected to A0 pin. This callback sends a "Button" message each time the button is pressed.
 2. a timer to send a "Ping" message each 5 mn
 3. a stanby mode feature

 ## Example 2: TestProtobufEndnode.ino
This example shows how to serialize/deserialize LoRaWAN messages with ProtocolBuffer.
The endnode device is the same as the one built in TestLMICWrapper.ino sample.
